Idea: Take image --> Sam, Kieran, Neither 
	Extra: Boxes where we are


1. Data Collection
	- Pictures of ourselves (doesn't have to be selfie or just us) 
	- Include just you and with others.
	- If both of us are in the picture label both (when it comes to it)	
	- Let's start with 50 images each (80-20 split for train/test)
		- 80 images train - 20 images for test
		- 50 images each -- 40 of which are training and 10 of which are testing
	- We don't care about image size (re-evaluate later)
		

2. Data cleaning / preprocessing / labeling
	- 256x256x3 size
	- Maybe lets do some data augmentation
	- Tools for this: Numpy + Pandas + Torchvision

3. Model (layers)
	- Convolutions (Resnet)
	- Look more at layers/models/stuff
	- Tools for this: PyTorch

4. Testing
	- just test on test data
